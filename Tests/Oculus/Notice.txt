The Oculus uses a hardcoded root certificate so the hosts method might not work if it was proper encrypted. 


But to collect:
* edge-oculus-shv-01-frt3.fbcdn.net: This address is used for Updates, downloading Oculus Store Content and more stuff. Seems OK So far.
* edge-mqtt-shv-01-frt3.facebook.com: These seem to be the FB mqtt server. MQTT = MQ Telemetry Transport Denying via Windows Firewall seems to work fine.
* edge-star-shv-01-frt3.facebook.com: Still don't really know what this is maybe 'hello?'
